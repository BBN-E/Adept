KABUL, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghan National Security Forces ( ANSF) supported by
NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) have seized and
destroyed "a sizeable quantity of drugs and weapons" in southern Afghanistan,
said an ISAF statement released here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The joint forces during the operation in the Nawa area of southern province
Helmand earlier this week discovered about 400 kilograms of wet opium in the
targeted compound with an estimated street value of nearly 1.5 million U.S.
dollars, the statement said. "Those drugs were destroyed later."
</P>
<P>
It said that large number of weapons and ammunition were also found at the same
place, including rocket propelled grenades, mortar rounds, small arms and
components of explosive .
</P>
<P>
ISAF indicated in the statement that "discovery of such a combination of drugs
and weapons in the same compound clearly highlights the link between insurgents
and narco-criminals and shows how the insurgency continues to be funded by
criminal activity."
</P>
<P>
UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in a report issued in November revealed
that the opium industry is largely funding the Taliban's war budget and a major
source of revenue for criminal groups and terrorists in Afghanistan as the anti-
government militants could clear 500 million U.S. dollars from the industry in
2008.

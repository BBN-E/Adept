<p>This package consists of all classes and interfaces related to the Adept Knowledge Base v3. </p>
<p>
Any algorithm producing entity level annotations that is compliant with the Adept API can use the functionality provided here to populate the knowledge base, modify it and query it.
</p>
<p>
1. Using the API<br>
================
<br><br>
The adept.kbapi.KB class encapsulates a connection to the KnowledgeBase.  It must be passed a KBParameters object which can be loaded as a 
resource or manually configured.

To insert KB objects, create InsertionBuilders from the static methods on their object types (ex. KBEntity.entityInsertionBuilder(...))

To query or delete KB objects, use the methods on the KB class.
 
</p>
<p>
2. Adept KB Ontology<br>
====================
<br><br>
The Adept KB ontology is defined to be compatible with both the TAC Cold Start and Rich-ERE ontologies. For systems that use either of the two standard type systems, we have included functionality that automatically maps the types generated by them to appropriate Adept ontology types. To
enable this functionality, create insertion builders using the appropriate instance of the KBOntologyMap class. 
<br>
The Adept ontology files can be viewed at the location adept-kb/src/main/resources/ontology.

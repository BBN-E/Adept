<p>This package consists of all classes and interfaces related to the Adept Knowledge Base v1. </p>
<p>
Any algorithm producing entity level annotations that is compliant with the Adept API can use the functionality provided here to populate the knowledge base, modify it and query it.
</p>
<p>
1. Using the API<br>
================
<br><br>
The classes providing the main functionality are KBUpdateProcessor.java and KBQueryProcessor.java. The former class contains API methods that allow insertion and modifications of entities and relations in the KB.<br>
The latter provides several methods to query the knowledge base in varying capacities, at both entity and mention levels. <br>
Every API method modifies the knowledge base atomically, in other words if a part of the transaction fails, any changes made during the course of its execution are appropriately aborted. <br>

To begin using the API, the parameters in the configuration file at adept-kb/src/main/resources/adept/kbapi/KBParameters.xml are required to be set as needed. 
</p>
<p>
2. Adept KB Ontology<br>
====================
<br><br>
The Adept KB ontology is defined to be compatible with both the TAC Cold Start and Rich-ERE ontologies. For systems that use either of the two standard type systems, we have included functionality that automatically maps the types generated by them to appropriate Adept ontology types. To
enable this functionality, the appropriate map file will need to be specified in the KBParameters.xml file. 
<br>
The Adept ontology files can be viewed at the location adept-kb/src/main/resources/ontology.

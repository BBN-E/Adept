##
## * Number of entities|relations|events: 	This is the count of distinct objects inserted by the system.
##
## * Confidence Range: 	This is range in confidence reported by the system for entities/relations/events. 
##	If the min and max number are the same, the system is probably using a default value for confidence.
##		These values are aggregated from column D of the entities.csv and column C of relations.csv and 
##		events.csv
##
## * Max Mention Count: 	This is largest number of document level justifications for the 
## entity/relation/event. 
##	If the number is 1, then the system is probably doing one of the following
##		 (a) Processing only a small number of documents (this would lead to a low value for 'Number of 
##			 entities|relations|events' as well). 
##		 (b) Never performing coreference for the object type (i.e. implementing a 'shatter baseline') 
##		 (c) Filtering to a single justification when populating the KB.
##		This value is aggregated from column E of the entities.csv and column D of relations.csv and 
##		events.csv
##
## * Max Distinct Docs: 	This the number of distinct documents for which justifications for the object 
##	can be found.
##	If the number is 1, then the system is probably doing one of the following
##		 (a) Processing only a single document (this would lead to a low value for 'Number of 
##			 entities|relations|events' as well). 
##		 (b) Never performing cross-document coreference for the object type (i.e. implementing a 'shatter 
##			 baseline' across documents) 
##		 (c) Filtering to a single justification when populating the KB.
##		This value is aggregated from column F of the entities.csv and column E of relations.csv and 
##		events.csv
##
## * Max Distinct Strings (entities only): 	This the number of distinct mention level strings for this 
## entity. If the number is 1 and the 'Max Mention Count' is greater than 1, it is likely the system's only
## form of coreference is exact string match.
##		This value is aggregated from column G of the entities.csv
##
## * Number of Arguments Range (events/relations/sentiments/beliefs only): 	This is the range in reported number of 
## arguments for an event, relation, sentiment, belief.  For relations, the expected number of arguments is 2. For 
## events, the expected number of arguments will vary by the the event type.
## If the min/max is 0, then the system is reporting some (or all) relations/events without any 
## arguments. For events, if the number is 1, it is likely the system is finding arguments but not 
## linking them (the 2015 EAL task). For events, if the number is less 4, it is likely the system 
## either processed only a small number of documents or doesn't find all argument in the ontology.
##		This value is aggregated from column P of relations.csv, events.csv, sentiments.csv, and beliefs.csv
##
## * Entity Types (entities only): 	The set of types found by the system.  This could include any of: 
##  Organization, Location, Person, GeoPoliticalEntity,(add more).
## 	This summary can be useful in understanding what subset of the ontology a system has focused on 
##  (e.g. Person, but not Organization).
##	If the system only ran on a small number of documents, some types could be missing because they 
##  did not appear in the data. If a system assigns multiple types to the same entity, these will appear 
##	in a comma separated list between square brackets.  For example [Person, Organization].  
##		This list is aggregated from column A of entities.csv
##
## * Relation/Event Types and Roles: 	The set of Event/Relation/Sentiment/Belief types 
## paired with the roles found by the system. 
##	The format for this list is Type1:{Role1, Role2, ..., RoleN}; Type2:{Role1, Role2, ..., RoleN}.
##	This summary can be useful in understanding what subset of the ontology a system has focused on 
##  (e.g. Place, but not Time roles). For sentiments/belief, Role includes both the Role and the ontology 
## 	of the thing in that role (e.g. "target(adept.kbapi.KBRelationArgument)"). 
##	If the system only ran on a small number of documents, some types/roles could be missing because 
##  they did not appear in the data. 
##		This types in this list are aggregated from column A. Their are collected from Q and beyond.

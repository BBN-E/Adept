. . . An irony occurs to me. The

Saudis and OPEC did the U.S. a substantial favor after September 11 in
not

making further production cuts to offset the fall in petroleum prices

caused by the depressed demand after the attacks and the continued US

recession. This inaction, apparently led by the Saudis, is among the

reasons for which the US administration was so happy with the latter

despite the widespread criticisms of Saudi Arabia in the press and
among

the public here.

OPEC's willingness to take the hit was one factor in a relatively
rapid US

economic turnaround and even possibly the end of the recession (which
may

in fact only have been a turn down). $18 a barrel petroleum was a huge

boon to a US on the ropes. In turn, this economic recovery took away
the

last issue on which the Democrats could campaign against Bush in the

upcoming November congressional elections.

If the recent rise in prices to around $28 a barrel is in fact mainly
a

result of speculation in the hedge markets and based upon a strong

likelihood that Bush will go to war against Iraq, it may mean that the

administration is shooting itself in the foot politically. The rise in

prices has badly hurt the stock market and could contribute to a

lengthening economic malaise (the recovery was expected to be tepid in
any

case). A bad economy could give back the Democrats their issue and

prevent Republicans from recapturing the Senate in November.

Is sabre-rattling abroad interfering with the fierce Bush political

campaign to win back the Senate? If so, it further illustrates the

difficulty for a sitting president of trying to govern from the far
right,

domestically and internationally, when the mainstream in both spheres
is

substantially more moderate.

Sincerely,

Juan Cole

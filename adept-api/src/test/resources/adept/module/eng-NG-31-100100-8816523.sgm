I apologize if this is a duplication post. The more we can raise the more we can help Shaz at Rhinelander. Please take a moment enter to win many of our great prizes! Â Permission to crosspost is granted and encouraged! Thanks.

Dear friends of the rat community,

A couple of months ago, the moderator team of Rat Lovers United and some good rat loving friends (Drusilla Kehl of The Illustrated Rat and Janet Girard of Jagwear Jewelry) put in effort to create a fundraiser to benefit rats for promotion and for the education of proper treatment of rats and their health care. Due to circumstances beyond our control, our fundraiser had to be cancelled. Although we were all disappointed of the last minute cancellation, things do happen for a reason.
I believe now, that the reason was for the resident rats in need of Rhinelander Rat Rescue, and the person who devotes so much time for their well-being.

Those of you who have been around for years in the rat community know that when one of our own was in deep with health care bills and health trouble for their rats, somehow we all chip in to help each other whether it would be donations of money or material. Those of you who are new to the community will see just how close we all really do stick by one another. Well, one of our own has been struck down, and needs our help.

Shaz of Rhinelander Rat Rescue http://www.geocities.com/rhinelander_rat_rescue
has taken in the homeless and abandoned, flourished the sick back to health, raised ratties to be socially friendly, and adopted out rats to responsible rat lovers to create a better life for the rats she loves so much. That is her passion afterall. In reality, most of us have this passion too. We can all help rats in different ways with our own gifts and talents.

Are Rats not the one love we all share together and have in common? Are they not like our comic relief on bad days? Our understanding of true love in life? After all, they never will choose to hate us. Do they not stick by us and love us no matter what we do or face? They are not capable of hate, but only capable of love.
And love is what I am asking for, for our ratty children in need from our rat parent community. To combine our love together as rat lovers united and help a respected friend in the rat community so that she may continue on with her gifts and talents to provide for the rats in need.

Below is Shasta's words that was sent to Rat Lovers United.
After you read her post that was sent to RLU, please check out the fundraising raffle that we offer to benefit her needs.

Hello everyone,

I usualy am a very efficient rescue, basically self funded and have been for 2 years. However I have a serious problem on my hands. For the past few months I have been selling things on ebay under the ID of whitewolf1-54501 and the money has been going towards 2 tumor removals and a nueter of rescued rats that reside here. Sargent, who is a black berkshire double rex female. Sage a gorgeous and very squishy agouti female, and to get Pirate, an aggressive male, nuetered so he can live with some of my females.

Sargent is 2 years and three months old, last year she had a tumor removed and has been doing great since. However she has developed a fast growing fatty tumor in the same spot as where her other tumor was removed. I was not to worried about it and neither was my vet at the time. It has since doubled in size and is affecting her walking and is now growing over her bladder. Despite useing mushroom therapy, it has to be removed. She is in excellent health otherwise. Sargent is a resident rat here as she was the last one born and the runt. Sargents mother was rescued from a snake bin at a LPS and was pregnant. Her mother haveing the litter started my rescue 2 years ago. Now that her mother is gone Saregent is the mascot of hte Rhinelander Rat Rescue. She is also Daniels sister...he owns Carol J from this board.

Sage is 1 year and 8 months old, she was rescued with 14 sisters and brothers. The gal had gotten a rat from a LPS and unknown to her she was pregnant. She had a litter of 15 and 14 survived. The gal that surendered them to me was going to take the babies back to the petshop where she originaly had bought mom from. Destined to most likely become snake food I took the whole litter. Sage was not able to be adopted because she had socialization issues and still does to this day. She is alright with me but gets nippy around strange hands that she doesn't know. Sage's tumor is a mammory tumor and has been maintained through mushroom therapy for the last few months and is now starting to grow again.

Pirate is a 1year 3 month old male that I recieved from Illinois. He was meant to be a companion rat to my sister in laws Black hooded male. However when Pirate got to about 6 months old he started fighting with her rat and badly injured him. My sister n law seperated them, however he became aggressive to anything that came near his cage, and ended up taking off half of her siamese kitten's ear. Pirate ended up back here and I have been working on his manners. He still is not accepting ANY male rats and is rather huffy and aggressive even if his cage is near the other males cages. I believe nuetering him will calm him down enough so that he can live with some of my females instead of living alone. Because of his biteing through the bars of his cage he is now a resident here.

I had everything ready to go, and all of the money covered for these surgeries until this past Friday.
Pookie my 16 year old cat got really sick and had to be rushed to the vet. She was admited with an infection in her kindeys, dehydration and the possible start of renal failure. The funds set aside for my rats have to go into my Pookie. The bill on friday alone was $135.00 and the estimate from the vet for Pookies care over this weekend is $540.00. So now I am back to square 1 raiseing funds for my tumor removals and Pirates nuetering. The Cat vet here is not willing to take payments. So despite my pride I am looking for help. I would turn to my very supportive family however, my father works at radio shack and his pay is based on mainly commission sales...they cut his hours down to 15 a week. So my mother is the main money maker to pay bills, and I am helping out where ever I can. So this is a huge blow.
I am selling things on ebay some rat related stuff. More will be listed today. Search for items listed by whitewolf1-54501
If anyone can donate the paypal address is rhinelander_rat_res ... @charter.net I will be sending out thank you and hammocks to people who help out. Also my mailing address is
Shasta Kuehl
1418 N stevens st Rhinelander WI 54501

I honestly don't know where else to turn for help. I also need all the well wishes and prayers you can give. The rat community means more to me then you will ever know.

Introduction

high-tech operate engineering company IPM develops and patent grant
with DE10328937 a dual high power, high voltage, high frequency
switching unit which works with hybrid drives, compact EMI safe
semiconductor stages, supporting capacitors and high voltage ferrite
transformers to generate extremely short HV pulses and sparking
groups. Advantages are based on uses of standard circuits with
extended semiconductors for e.g. nano, sub or micro perforation
applications, corona treatments etc.

IPM is looking for science or industrial partners who are interested
in a licence agreement and/or technical cooperation for other wide
application fields.

Working principle

Industry application of electro or electrostatic perforation at fast
running paper webs uses IGBT, MOSFET or HVFET semiconductor power
stages. These circuits working as upward converters with extremely
short time power pulses in ranges from 200 ns up to 15 µs, high
current peaks up to 300 Amps by du/dt of 1500V/µs on a serial
connected inductivity and loading condenser that the secondary ferrite
transformer coils supply the sparking electrodes up to 50 KVss as a
permanent open loop and short circuit.

A safety circuit logic and two hybrid drivers allows a alternately
switching of semiconductor A/B which generating higher operation
frequencies and power levels meanwhile the electrical/thermal
conditions remains on each in the same range as a single switching
unit.

In conclusion the approximately double frequency and power level
operation obtains higher switching efficiencies, more perforation
power or higher corona treatment level, depend of the industry
application.

Advantages

Dual IGBT, HVFETS or MOSFETS semiconductors in high power, high
current, high voltage circuits obtains in electrostatic nano, sub
micro perforation, surface treatment, nano surface modifications,
corona treatment or other switching application frequencies up to 250
KHz, 1400 V/ce, power levels up to 30 KW and more. Higher power
efficiencies and harder switching periods are further advantages.

A controlled pulse timing into a certain time window with a constant
or variable frequency generates hole sizes and hole sequences with
high voltage sparking through the material webs. The repeating
frequencies of the entire circuit can up to the double switching
frequency of each semiconductor.

For example by electrostatic perforation porosity ranges from 80 C.U.
- 2500 C.U., paper web speeds up to 450 m/min and web widths up to
2000 mm are archive able.

Other applications

Corona treatment units, surface treatment, high power switching
devices, power supplies, AC/DC drives, AC/DC or AC/AC converters,
laser diode power supplies, compact switching converter systems, etc.

The new dual semiconductor allows applications to build hybrid drives,
semiconductor high-level stage, upward, downward or other converters
or generators which operating with supporting capacitors, high-voltage
ferrite transformers in an extremely compact and modular way. Several
advantages are the high efficiency of pulse/power transmission and
energy ratios.

Traditional corona or other medium frequency generators up to 30 KHz
operation range are easy to modify to double frequency and power
levels.

Patent grant for process and device DE10328937 of IGBT power switching
unit.

Future prospects

The electrostatic ESP nano or micro perforation in pore ranges from 10
nm up to 100 um usually applies within ranges of the refinement of
fine paper, packaging webs, bonded fabrics, non-woven, filter paper,
bag or force paper as well as special paper webs of most diverse kind
especially when additionally treating course materials for achieving
special characteristics which for physical or process reasons cannot
be achieved by other process technologies.

Our highly modern, industrially approved ESP perforation technology
operation which even can be relied on when operated 24/7 can be
integrated into existing rewinding course devices or other course
devices. Also, they can be used as completely independent perforation
devices.

Micro Perforation

Perforation results are now achieve for nano, sub and micro
perforation of flexible webs with ultra small pores and products made
of these materials. Materials finishing are of interest for numerous
tasks in the field of packaging, in filling, non woven industry, for
technical and science applications, etc.

For many years fine and other paper webs with base weights between 20
up to 150 g/sqm have been perforated electro statically in large areas
or zone designs.

Pore sizes from 10 nm to 100 microns, pore distributions of up to 10
Million/sqm in area perforation or respectively 2OO/sqcm by zone
perforation by up to 16 Million holes per Second can be reached.

Air permeabilities or porosity ranges are among from 50 up to 2,500
C.U. (ml/sqcm/min) respectively 3 to 50 l/sqm/sec. (Franksystem ) are
now possible.

Web width from 100 to 2000 mm at speeds of up to 500 m/min, depending
on porosity and material consistency in relation to it's ability to
perforate.

New ranges of applications will be made accessible as new products
with special features will be developed.

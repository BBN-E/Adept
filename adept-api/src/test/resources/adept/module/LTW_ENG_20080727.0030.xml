Leader Says Iran Has Expanded Uranium-Producing Capability

<P>
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Saturday that
his country dramatically had expanded the number of machines at its disposal
producing enriched uranium, defying international demands for the country to
halt the production of nuclear material.
</P>
<P>
But the hard-line leader, quoted by official and semi-official media,
also appeared to suggest that Iran might be willing to stop adding more
centrifuges, a condition for preliminary talks to end the diplomatic
standoff over Iran's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
And experts played down the significance of Ahmadinejad's claim. "It's
not just the number of centrifuges that counts," said a Western diplomat in
Tehran, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It's whether they're running
and how well."
</P>
<P>
Still, he added, Ahmadinejad's assertion "won't help" resolve the
standoff between Iran and the West.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad told scholars in the northeastern Iranian city of Mashhad
that Iran possessed more than 5,000 centrifuges, which can produce nuclear
material suitable for a power plant or, if highly enriched, an atomic bomb.
A May report by the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran had about
3,500 centrifuges running.
</P>
<P>
"The West wanted us to stop," Ahmadinejad was quoted as telling the
scholars. "We resisted, and now they want to resume negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Confusion clouded media reports about the actual number Ahmadinejad
cited. One Iranian news agency quoted Ahmadinejad as saying Iran had 6,000
centrifuges working, before taking the report off its Web site. Another said
he referred to "hundreds and thousands" of centrifuges.
</P>
<P>
In theory, 6,000 centrifuges running continuously can produce enough
weapons-grade uranium for one bomb in six months. But Iran repeatedly has
asserted that it is not trying to build a nuclear weapon, which its
religious leaders have decried as un-Islamic. And the Islamic Republic's
enrichment program also has been bedeviled by technical problems, say
diplomats and arms-control experts.
</P>
<P>
Iran insists its controversial nuclear program is meant only to provide
electricity. But the U.S., Israel, Europe and most Western arms-control
experts suspect Iran is trying to at least attain the capability to begin
producing bombs quickly if it so decides. Turning the reactor-grade uranium
Iran now produces into weapons-grade material is relatively easy, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
Iran says eventually it hopes to have more than 50,000 centrifuges
operating at its enrichment plant near the town of Natanz. In April, it said
it was on the verge of putting a total of 6,000 centrifuges operating.
Ahmadinejad's comments Saturday were first public statement asserting an
expansion.
</P>
<P>
"We knew they were heading toward 6,000 assembled," said Jeffrey G.
Lewis, an arms control expert at the New America Foundation, a think tank.
"But there's some dispute as to whether they're running them or
not."
</P>
<P>
European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana recently offered the
Iranians a U.S.-endorsed package of incentives meant to entice them to stop
producing enriched uranium. He also proposed a six-week period of
pre-negotiations, called "freeze for freeze," during which Iran would add no
centrifuges and the West would refrain from pushing for a fourth round of
economic sanctions against Iran at the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Iran failed to respond to either offer during talks last Saturday in
Geneva, which were attended by U.S. Undersecretary of State William J. Burns
in the highest-level diplomatic contact between Iran and the U.S. for nearly
30 years.
</P>
<P>
Solana, Burns and European envoys gave Iran a deadline of late July to
respond positively to the offer or face a new round of sanctions, which
could include prohibitions on selling Iran refined petroleum products it
desperately needs to run its economy.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have decried the deadline and refused to commit to
stopping the expansion of the program. But in his latest comments,
Ahmadinejad appeared to leave open the possibility that Iran would stop
expanding, albeit at a higher number of centrifuges than previously thought
and for longer than six weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Today they (the West) have agreed that the existing 5,000 to 6,000
centrifuges do not increase and that there is no problem if this number of
centrifuges work," Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying by state radio,
according to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials repeatedly stated that no negotiations can begin with
Iran before it verifiably halts all enrichment-related activities. But the
Bush administration recently softened its stance, agreeing to sign on to the
"freeze for freeze" proposal and to dispatch Burns to Geneva.

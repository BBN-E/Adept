(AP) Half of Americans think Facebook is a passing fad, according to the results of a new Associated Press-CNBC poll. And, in the run-up to the social network's initial public offering of stock, half of Americans also say the social network's expected asking price is too high.

The company Mark Zuckerberg created as a Harvard student eight years ago is preparing for what looks to be the biggest Internet IPO ever. Expected later this week, Facebook's Wall Street debut could value the company at $100 billion, making it worth more than Disney, Ford and Kraft Foods.

That's testament to the impressive numbers Facebook has posted in its relatively brief history. More than 40 percent of American adults log in to the site _to share news, personal observations, photos and more_ at least once a week. In all, some 900 million people around the world are users. Facebook's revenue grew from $777 million in 2009 to $3.7 billion last year. And in the first quarter of 2012 it was more than $1 billion.

Just a third of those surveyed think the company's expected value is appropriate, 50 percent say it is too high. Those who invest in the stock market are more likely to see Facebook as overvalued, 58 percent said so. About 3 in 10 investors say the expected value of shares is fair.......................(more)

1. I would leave Facebook in a New York minute...... if another site that guaranteed my privacy came along. I don't think I'm alone in that.

As it is, I never post a thing and I use a separate browser that's just for Facebook. Even so, every time I'm on a webpage that has a Facebook link, I'm worried that somehow I forgot to log out and my friends will see I'm reading a story about the Kardashians or something. I don't recommend comments on the NY Times website because both sites have my e-mail address and I'm afraid any recommendation I'd make there will show up on my Facebook page. But I dislike Facebook less than I like my friends, so I'm staying... for now. If a Mozilla equivalent of Facebook were developed, I would never use it again.

6. There are... several, in fact. I like diaspora, as it has one of the larger communities. Problem is getting your friends to quit FB.

Facebook IS a fad. It's not a matter of opinion. That's exactly what, by definition, it is.

2. I deleted my FB account last Sunday. The primary reason is the escalation in the number of employers asking for FB login info. As I'm on the job hunt I decided it was better to simply answer with the truth if it came up, I don't have FB.

I was hoping Zuckerberg would take a strong, active stance against this practice, but then I realized FB was created to do just what these employers are doing, violate my privacy. From day 1 that was FB's purpose.

The second reason I deleted FB is what it was teaching me. I was learning that valued family members and friends were bigots, homophobes, and extreme right republicans. I was learning things about people I've known for 30+ years and wished I had never read. People will post things to FB they would never say in public. It a phenomenon I just don't understand.

So I deleted my FB acct. I'll miss some of the things about it, but overall I found it to do more harm than good.

As for the stock? No I don't think FB is worth even 25 billion much less 100. I also see the stock rising quickly at first release, then plummeting within a few weeks back to or below it's offering price.

3. A lot of people probably still think FB is a place where you post pictures of your lunch and gossip about others, or bitch about your zits.

4. Facebook has been going strong for quite a long time now to be just a fad. Fad implies something with less of a lifespan than its already endured, in my opinion.

8. I don't think so. It has revolutionized the way people keep in touch and there's no going back. If FB itself fades, something similar that is like a giant interactive worldwide bulletin board will take its place.

What is the stance of the anglican church on the issue of renewal movements like the one which came out of the Toronto blessing?
I have met several anglicans who said their congregation is moving in renewal in a way that sounds almost charasmatic or pentecostal.

There is a website for the toronto church which is where the "toronto blessing " happened. <a href="http://www.tacf.org">www.tacf.org</a>. It stands for toronto airport christian fellowship. I have been there myself to visit. It used to be a vineyard church and is that style but is now independent I think.
I know some friends who live here in calgary who go to a vineyard church and said they were anglican when they lived in England and that their church was moving in toronto style renewal but when they came here they switched to vineyard because the anglican parish here is not. They said their parrish back home was similar to a vineyard church.

While i agree with you that there is a significant element within the anglican church moving in a pentecostal direction, i also think the inverse is also true. I think the Anglo-Catholics are growing in support tremendously, are there is an increasing disparity within the church- this has been highlighted recently with the homosexual debate and women priests.
Not sure if that really answers your question, but that's my input anyway <img src="http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

I'm curious if this church is a Charismatic Episcopal Church parallel. If so, then it really isn't a member of the Anglican Church.

If not, there are those Anglican parishes that are becoming more charismatic, but they are few and far inbetween compared to those parishes who are becoming much more like the Early Church of the Apostles and Ecumenical Councils. The Second Vatican rediscovered many things that the "Western Church" had lost or fogotten, and that has spread into the Methodists, Lutherans, and Anglicans especially as well as the Catholic Church.

It really doesn't sound very orthodox of an Anglican perish to become so charismatic. Although we acknowledge the gifts of the Holy Spirit, we, like the Early Church, do not place as much emphasis on them as Pentecostals and Charismatics do. We believe that the idea of extreme emotion that those Christian groups experience isn't traditional and somewhat strange. That is why charismatic Anglicans are so rare.

This isn't to say that Pentecostals or Charismatic Christians aren't good or true Christians. Its simply that their ideas are foreign to us and our vision.

Ever heard of Faith Alive? That's one way to get the church into renewal. I've seen some terrific things happen through an event, and the entire church is involved. I've worked on two teams for two different churches. Take care.

My big concern would be this "barking in the spirit" and things of that nature that the Toronto movement exthols. Their services are too chaotic, too unorganized for my personal liking. Just my two cents.

I echo your views about that Bartimeus. All churchs need to have an appeal as wide as possible, but they also need to maintain some sort of consistency. A church should be a sanctuary, and i don't think i'd be too happy to attend a church where i knew that i didn't agree with all that was going on there.

Ok, from what I've further read is that this isn't an Anglican church (although the OP never said he did but I originally thought he implied it; my most sincere apologies for the misunderstanding...my fault!) but what seems to me to be a Pentecostal ministry.

As such, the rest of my above post IMO still holds. The Anglican Church isn't charsimatic. Although there are some charismatic-like churches that use the Anglican name, they are mostly those of the Charismatic Episcopal Church, which is not in Full Communion with the See of Canterbury (thus not "fully" Anglican). There are those parishes in the AC that are charismatic, but they are few and far inbetween, and since I've never been to one, I couldn't tell you of my full opinion about them. So long as a person uses the gifts of the Holy Spirit properly and in a traditional way (Holy Tradition is important to us Anglicans), then we don't have a problem. <img src="http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

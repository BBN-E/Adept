ROME (RNS) The Vatican said Monday (March 17) that Pope Francis will preside over a prayer vigil dedicated to victims of mob violence in Italy and their families.

Its a sensitive issue for Francis after a famed anti-mob prosecutor last year said the popes financial reforms were making mob bosses very nervous and could expose the pope to assassination plots.

The special service, to be held Friday (March 21), is expected to include at least 700 Italians who lost a family member to violence connected to Italys various organized crime organizations.

The meeting with the pope is a gift for the families of innocent victims, said the Rev. Luigi Ciotti, the Turin-based priest who will host the prayer vigil, calling Francis decision to attend a symbolic nod to our fragile and wounded humanity.

1. What about the mobs in Uganda? How is the guy in charge of 42% of an anti gay mob not himself a creator of mob violence?
A conundrum.

3. He needs to speak out against the law. But I doubt it will do anything at this point.

4. Uh-oh... Isn't that how JP1 got into trouble? Messing around with the Vatican Bank can give a Pope a well-timed heart attack.

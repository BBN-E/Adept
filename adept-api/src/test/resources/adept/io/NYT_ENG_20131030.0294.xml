LONDON - The British oil company BP said Tuesday that its profit for the third quarter, adjusted for one-time items, was $3.7 billion. That was down 26 percent from the period a year earlier, but it exceeded analysts’ forecast.
</P>
<P>
BP also said that it would continue its aggressive program of asset sales with a target of $10 billion in additional sales by 2015. The money raised will be used mostly to pay for distributions to shareholders, probably through share buybacks, the company said. BP has already completed about $3.8 billion of an $8 billion buyback program begun earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
BP’s net profit dropped 34 percent, to $3.5 billion, in the quarter. The company also said that it would increase its quarterly dividend by 5.6 percent, to 9.5 cents a share, payable in December, reflecting increasing confidence on the part of management. BP’s share price rose 5.6 percent on Tuesday in London.
</P>
<P>
The company continues to look ahead, even as it is still working through the legal and financial ramifications of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. It has sold about $38 billion worth of oil fields and other properties over the last three years, not counting the sale of its Russian affiliate TNK-BP to the state-controlled Rosneft for about $27.5 billion in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
Robert W. Dudley, who replaced Tony Hayward as chief executive after the oil spill, has led a reorganization aimed at raising cash and giving the sprawling company a tighter focus.
</P>
<P>
The company’s profit declined from the previous year primarily from the impact of the asset sales, particularly the Russian deal, as oil-field sales led to lower production. In the third quarter, BP earned about $800 million from its nearly 20 percent share in Rosneft, compared with about $1.2 billion from its TNK-BP stake a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Excluding Russia, where BP has no operational control, BP’s production fell about 2 percent from a year earlier, to about 2.2 million barrels a day, the company said. BP’s profit from refining crude oil were also substantially lower.
</P>
<P>
In some respects, Dudley appears to be succeeding in steering BP to a new normal as a smaller - if still large - company. BP is planning to complete 16 to 18 exploration wells, more than in the last three years combined, at a cost of about $3 billion. BP said that so far from those wells, it had made two gas discoveries off India and one off Egypt, as well as an oil discovery announced on Tuesday off Angola. But investors continue to be concerned about the extent of BP’s liabilities in the United States from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster.
</P>
<P>
BP is “certainly much closer to normal,” said Peter Hutton, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London, but “it is not out of the woods yet.” He said it was positive for BP that it had set aside no additional financial provisions because of the Gulf of Mexico spill.
</P>
<P>
While BP is expanding its drilling operations, the company continues its fight in Louisiana courts to limit penalties and payments to claimants arising from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion that killed 11 workers and polluted Gulf of Mexico waters and hundreds of miles of coastline with oil.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the civil trial, which will determine billions of dollars in penalties, ended two weeks ago. The United States government argued that 4.2 million barrels was discharged into the sea, while BP countered that the amount was closer to 2.45 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
At stake are Clean Water Act fines that range from a maximum of $1,100 for every barrel spilled through simple negligence to as much as $4,300 a barrel if the company is found to have been grossly negligent. Fines potentially could amount to more than $18 billion. But if BP’s position is upheld - that there was simple negligence and only 2.45 million barrels of spillage - total fines would amount to no more than $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Carl J. Barbier ordered BP and the federal government along with its aligned claimants to submit summaries of evidence by Dec. 20, with responses due by late January. A third phase of the trial, sometime next year, will address the environmental effects of the disaster.

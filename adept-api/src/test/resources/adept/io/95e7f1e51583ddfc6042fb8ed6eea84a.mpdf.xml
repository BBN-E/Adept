I just chose rock just because that's what I listen to the most often... But I like all genres.

I voted for Country 'cause that's my favourite style, but I also like some Reggae, Rock, Pop and Blues, as well as Soul and Rap so I'm more eclectic.

I voted classic rock, I really can't get into the newer stuff. I also used to be into rap alot but since I've gotten older I just can't relate to it anymore.

I listen to a lot of things, but I don't know how to categorize it, so I chose other as well.

I love rock music, from Elvis and Buddy Holly, through the 60's and the Beatles, the Stones, Who, Hendrix, etc., 70's power pop rock like Foghat and Grand Funk Railroad, of course Led Zeppelin, some of the 80's alt-rock like Talking Heads and REM, the 90's like Pearl Jam and Dinosaur Jr., and currently the rock I listen to is Ween, Anathema, Opeth, etc.

I also like alt-country-roots rock like the Jayhawks, Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt, Wilco, Drive By Truckers, Ryan Adams, Lucinda Williams, Tish Merritt, Ani DiFranco, and Gov't Mule.

And on and on and on... <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

Same here, I understand exactly what you mean. I had a rap phase.. but that came to an abrupt end when I heard the song 'High Hopes' by Pink Floyd..

Romanian public service to improve through decentralization: PM

BUCHAREST, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- Public services in Romania will get closer to the citizens through the draft law on decentralization, Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Tuesday told a parliament plenum.

The central government wants to shorten the decision-making chain "to advance a public service that is under the direct coordination of the local elected voted by the citizens with less bureaucracy and less corruption," Ponta said.

The prime minister added that he was convinced his administration was in the right direction to reform the Romanian state.

A three-day deadline was announced for the submission of non-confidence motions against the law.

Under the draft law, portfolios such as healthcare, agriculture, environment, pre-university education, youth affairs and tourism will be switched under the authorities of the local administrations.

Police, social security services, cinema halls and ports will stay under the authorities of the central public administration.  Enditem

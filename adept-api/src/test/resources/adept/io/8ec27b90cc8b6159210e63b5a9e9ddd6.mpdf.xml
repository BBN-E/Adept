I just saw a post on OCnet that claims that the Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church will make an announcement Friday that they will allow the Ark to be seen.

The only source that I have found for this is WND (not exactly reliable). Has anyone else heard this?

Thats pretty amazing. Ill believe it when I see it. Has it even been confirmed that this church does have the true Ark?

I found it on this website as well. Maybe this really will happen. Wow! I wonder if they would open it...

They have always claimed to have the Ark, but no one outside of a select few within the Church have been allowed to see it.

Like you, I' will believe it when I see it. It would be pretty awsome if it is true though.

The time has past and I haven't heard anything.

From what I have seen, I doubt it would be accepted by some as a genuine Ark anyways. I saw a photo of what was claimed to be one of the replicas and it just looked like a carved wooden trunk. People are expecting to see gold and angels.

I found it kind of weird that 2 of the World's most famous people died on the same day that this news was revealed. Its almost as if the enemy is trying to cover it up...

It isn't going to be seen. I'm finding mentions that there is an update to the Italian site saying that it won't. I don't read Italian though.

Maybe WND finally sold enough of their Ark DVD sets.

I have heard a lot of theories where the Ark of the Covenant is. This is one of them. Who knows? Only God knows.

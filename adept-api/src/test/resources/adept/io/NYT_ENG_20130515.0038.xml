RUTGERS CHOOSES A WOMAN TO LEAD ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, Rutgers made an unconventional choice when it selected Tim Pernetti, a television executive, to lead its athletic department.
</P>
<P>
Pernetti’s hiring paid off handsomely as he invigorated donors and guided Rutgers through the disintegration of the Big East Conference, landing the university a highly coveted invitation to join the Big Ten. In April, however, Pernetti’s tenure came to an abrupt end when he was forced to resign after a video surfaced of Mike Rice, the men’s basketball coach, hurling balls at players and berating them with homophobic slurs in practice.

On Wednesday, Rutgers introduced Julie Hermann, the longtime second-in-command at Louisville’s athletic department, as its new athletic director. The appointment is yet another unconventional choice for Rutgers; Hermann becomes one of a relatively few women leading major sports programs and also assumes the helm without experience elsewhere as an athletic director.
</P>
<P>
Hermann, who has been involved in college athletics as a player, coach or administrator for more than 30 years, arrives at Rutgers at a time when the university’s athletic department is still dealing with the fallout of the Rice situation. Her task is not only managing the move to the Big Ten, but also repairing the image of the university’s athletic department and winning back supporters angered by the basketball scandal.
</P>
<P>
At an introductory news conference on the university’s New Brunswick, N.J., campus, Hermann, flanked by the Rutgers president Robert W. Barchi and members of the committee that selected her, said team practices would be an “open book.”
</P>
<P>
“We will no longer have any practice anywhere, anytime that anybody couldn’t walk into and be pleased about what is going on in that environment,” said Hermann, who begins her job June 17.
</P>
<P>
At Louisville, Hermann was the top deputy to Tom Jurich. She was responsible for 20 sports, including women’s basketball, field hockey, softball, and men’s and women’s swimming. A volleyball player at Nebraska, Hermann went on to coach at Tennessee, Northern Arizona and Georgia before joining Louisville.
</P>
<P>
Saying she has “been a woman in collegiate athletics all my life,” she called the move to Rutgers a “natural opportunity to step into.” She joins Kay Yow at North Carolina State and California’s Sandy Barbour as the only female athletic directors at universities in Bowl Championship Series conferences.
</P>
<P>
Hermann, however, has never been directly responsible for a football program, which, because of the finances of college sports, is the lifeblood of an athletic department. “I manage coaches for a living, whether it is the rowing coach or the football coach,” she said. She added that while working with Jurich, she also helped manage aspects of the football program. “You are not No. 2 in any athletic department in the country and not interfacing with the for-profit sports,” she said.
</P>
<P>
Jurich, who was hired at Louisville in 1997, said in a statement that he picked Hermann soon after his arrival to help build the athletic programs, calling her “a person I could count on throughout the past several years.”
</P>
<P>
“She has earned this opportunity and I’m confident she will go to work immediately to provide Rutgers a positive direction and be a terrific leader,” Jurich said.
</P>
<P>
In late November, university officials decided to suspend and fine Rice rather than fire him when a former assistant brought a video to their attention, showing Rice berating his players.
</P>
<P>
When ESPN showed the video in early April, the university faced criticism for not dismissing Rice, leading to Rice’s firing and Pernetti’s departure. Eddie Jordan, a former Rutgers player was hired last month to replace Rice. It was later revealed that he never graduated from Rutgers, another embarrassing episode for the university.

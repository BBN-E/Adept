Someone had a sudden impact on Chryslers Clint Eastwood Super Bowl spots availability on YouTube Sunday night.
Chrysler is investigating why the two-minute ad, which features the actor/director declaring this moment to be Americas halftime, got taken down, a rep told Mashable. At the time of this writing, the ad was back up on Chryslers YouTube channel.

According to multiple reports, there was a message on the channel Monday morning explaining the ad violated NFL copyrights. An NFL rep declined comments on the issue, deferring calls to Chrysler. However, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told the Detroit Free Press that the league didnt take the ad down and is asking Google to investigate.

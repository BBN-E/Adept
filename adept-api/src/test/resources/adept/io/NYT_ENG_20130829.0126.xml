NEW YORK - After months in which his campaign struggled to find its footing, Bill de Blasio is the front-runner in the Democratic primary for New York mayor, according to a survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey by Quinnipiac University found 36 percent of likely Democratic voters backed de Blasio, the public advocate. Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, who had long been the front-runner among Democrats, was backed by 21 percent, while William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller who in 2009 won the Democratic primary but lost the general election to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, had 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The results confirm a remarkable surge in support for de Blasio among likely Democratic voters, who tend to be significantly more liberal than the general electorate.
</P>
<P>
De Blasio has staked out liberal positions in several areas, pledging to raise taxes on the wealthy to finance early childhood education, railing against the Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practice and vowing to break with Bloomberg on multiple issues.
</P>
<P>
Through much of the campaign, he was overshadowed by Quinn, who would be the city’s first female mayor, and Anthony D. Weiner, a former congressman seeking to return to office after resigning from Congress over sexually explicit online communications.
</P>
<P>
The poll confirmed that support for Weiner collapsed when he acknowledged that he had continued to exchange sexually explicit messages with women a year after he resigned from the House. A month ago, he led in a Quinnipiac poll with 26 percent; now he is at 8 percent, barely ahead of another embattled candidate, Comptroller John C. Liu, who has been barred from receiving public money because of questions about the legality of his fundraising practices.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 602 likely Democratic voters was conducted from Aug. 22 to 27 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The likely Democratic voters do not appear to be fully committed to their expressed preferences. Nearly one-third said there was a “good chance” they would change their minds by the Sept. 10 primary.
</P>
<P>
But some of the candidates provoked strong negative reactions. Almost half of those surveyed said they would not, under any circumstance, vote for Weiner, while 29 percent said the same about Quinn, and 17 percent about Liu.
</P>
<P>
The race could be jolted, of course, by unexpected events on the campaign trail, or by a last-minute advertisement or a gaffe in the final debate, scheduled for Tuesday. But the candidates are already acting as if de Blasio has become the candidate to beat.
</P>
<P>
He was the focus of repeated attacks from his rivals in the debate last week. Quinn has unveiled a website, “Tale of Two de Blasios,” arguing that he flip-flops frequently on issues. Thompson released an ad accusing de Blasio of misrepresenting how his position on the stop-and-frisk practice differs from that of other candidates.

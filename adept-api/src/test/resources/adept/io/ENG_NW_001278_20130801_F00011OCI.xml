Societe Generale doubles Q2 net income to 955 mln euros

PARIS, Aug. 1 (Xinhua) -- Societe Generale, France's second biggest bank, registered a net income of 955 million euros (1.26 billion U.S. dollars) in the second quarter of 2013, up from 436 million euros generated last year boosted by strong deposits, the banking group's quarterly results showed on Thursday.

From April to June, Societe Generale reported a slight fall in revenue to 6.23 billion euros compared last year's 6.27 billion euros. However, its corporate and investment banking business posted "a very satisfactory performance," thanks to a "healthy level of activity for structured products and equity derivatives."

Despite weak demands for credit in France, the bank's domestic business revenue grew by 3 percent to 2 billion euros driven up by strong deposit inflow, according to the bank.

Gross operating income inched up 1.5 percent over the period to 2.32 billion euros while the operating costs fell to 3.9 billion euros compared to 3.98 billion euros recorded in the second quarter in 2012 following efforts to tighten expenditure and enhance operating management.

"Societe Generale ended the first half of 2013 with a healthy commercial performance, underpinned by substantial cost cutting efforts and good control of cost of risk," said Frederic Oudea, Societe Generale chairman.

"Ongoing transformation measures, combined with good business results and rigorous management of scarce resources, have led to the improvement of capital ratios," he added.  Enditem

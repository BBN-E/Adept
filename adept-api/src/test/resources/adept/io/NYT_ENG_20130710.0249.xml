When the police first spoke to Aaron Hernandez the day after the shooting death of his friend Odin Lloyd, Hernandez seemed unconcerned, but grew argumentative and asked, “What’s with all the questions?”
</P>
<P>
It was the night of June 17, and police officers were standing at the front door of Hernandez’s home in North Attleborough, Mass., about a half mile from where Lloyd’s body had been found five hours earlier. When the police said they were investigating a death, Hernandez abruptly slammed the door and locked it.
</P>
<P>
“Mr. Hernandez did not ask officers whose death was being investigated,” police officers wrote in a report contained in 156 pages of court records released about the Hernandez investigation Tuesday. “Mr. Hernandez’s demeanor did not indicate any concern for the death of any person.”
</P>
<P>
The police had come to Hernandez’s home because they had discovered the keys to a rental car leased to him on Lloyd’s bullet-riddled body, which was found in an industrial park near Hernandez’s home. When he was first approached and asked about Lloyd, Hernandez acknowledged being “up his way yesterday,” meaning in Boston, where Lloyd lived, according to the police report. As the questioning persisted, Hernandez, then a tight end for the New England Patriots, went inside his house and retrieved his lawyer’s card, which he gave to the investigators. He slammed the door shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
About 10 minutes later, Hernandez and his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, agreed to drive to the police station. While Hernandez waited for his lawyer inside the station, Jenkins spoke with officers outside.
</P>
<P>
She told them that Lloyd frequently smoked marijuana and was a marijuana dealer, the report said. She said that Lloyd’s phone rang constantly and that he talked in language that she interpreted as being code for drug transactions. The report said that Jenkins cried when she was told that Lloyd, who was dating Jenkins’ sister, had been murdered. As she was speaking with the police, Hernandez called her from inside the station and told her that his “sports agent said she should not speak with police” without a lawyer present, according to one of the unsealed documents.
</P>
<P>
During this time, the police also made an attempt to discover whom Lloyd had texted from his cellphone late on the night of June 16 and into the early morning of June 17. They picked up the cellphone found on Lloyd’s body and dialed the number. Inside the station, Hernandez’s cellphone rang.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, a man prosecutors have said was in the car with Hernandez on the night of Lloyd’s murder appeared in court in Massachusetts, but his hearing on a gun charge was delayed until Aug. 14. The Associated Press reported that the man, Carlos Ortiz, 27, has told Massachusetts investigators that the third man involved in the case, Ernest Wallace, said Hernandez admitted shooting Lloyd, according to documents filed by the Miramar, Fla., police department to justify a search of Wallace’s home there.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz, who is from Hernandez’s hometown of Bristol, Conn., has been charged with unlawful possession of a firearm in Massachusetts. He is being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
The documents released in Massachusetts on Tuesday contained additional details about the text messages Lloyd sent in the hours before he died, as well as Hernandez’s actions that evening.
</P>
<P>
Jenkins told the police that she and Hernandez went out for dinner on June 16 while a baby sitter stayed with their daughter. Jenkins went to bed early and said she was unaware of what Hernandez had done the rest of the night. The police report said that Hernandez first texted Lloyd at 9:05 p.m. Perhaps referring to Hernandez’s rented Chevy Suburban that Lloyd was seen driving near his home a day earlier, the text read, “I’m coming to grab that tonight u gon b around I need dat and we could step for a little again.”
</P>
<P>
At 10 p.m., Lloyd texted to Hernandez, “Aite idk anything goin on.”
</P>
<P>
Aite is slang for “all right” and idk is an acronym for “I don’t know.”
</P>
<P>
Hernandez replied, “I’ll figure it out ill hit u on the way.”
</P>
<P>
Police said Lloyd’s final text to Hernandez was at 12:22 a.m., “We still on.”
</P>
<P>
When Hernandez was arraigned on murder charges June 26, prosecutors said that Hernandez and two other men arrived at Lloyd’s house in Boston at 2:29 a.m. and texted Lloyd, “We’re here.” The group left in a silver Nissan Altima, also rented by Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have said that Lloyd, 27, was shot around 3:30 a.m. in North Attleborough, and that workers on a break at a business about 200 yards from where Lloyd’s body was found heard three gunshots.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder and five other gun-related charges. His lawyers have called the case against him “not strong” and “circumstantial.” The documents unsealed Tuesday contained no details that spoke to a motive for the killing. Prosecutors have said in court that Hernandez and Lloyd were in a Boston bar on June 14 and that Hernandez saw Lloyd talking with people Hernandez “had troubles with.”
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that an agitated Hernandez complained on June 16 that he could no longer trust anyone.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez is also being investigated in a double homicide in Boston in 2012.
</P>
<P>
The documents released Tuesday, which were unsealed at the request of three news outlets, detailed an inventory of items police found during several searches of Hernandez’s home and a condominium he rented in a nearby town. That inventory included a safe that contained a scale and a dish, a duffel bag that had bandages in it, a Blackberry, three iPads, an iPhone and some clothing and shoes.
</P>
<P>
The police also indicated that they tested a mattress and a piece of the bed skirt from that mattress for gunshot residue.
</P>
<P>
In subsequent searches of Hernandez’s homes and cars over several days, police found a rifle and multiple boxes of ammunition.

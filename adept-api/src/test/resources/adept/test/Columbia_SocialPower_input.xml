M1.1. Shelley,

M1.2. I will be out of the office tomorrow morning participating in a charity golf tournament

sponsored by EDS at South Shore Harbor.

M1.3. Mark Giglotti, Jeannie Licciardo, Don Stacy and I are playing together.

M1.4. I know the timing may be bad because of the financial project we have been preparing but

the charitable contribution to play was quite generous and I do not want to back out of my commitment

to the other team members.

M1.5. HOWEVER, IF YOU NEED ME FOR ANY REASON, PLEASE PAGE ME AT 1(800) 609-6967 OR CALL MY CELL

PHONE AT (713) 569-4140.

M1.6. ALMA WILL ALSO KNOW HOW TO GET A HOLD OF ME.

M1.7. I will only be 45 minutes away and will be able to come straight into the office, if needed.

M1.8. I will check in during the day with Linda Trevino, as she will be sitting in for me at

your staff meeting.

M1.9. Rick
